Step 1: Theoretical Foundation Derivation of Governing Equations A projectile is subject to uniform acceleration due to gravity and follows a parabolic trajectory. We assume: The projectile is launched with an initial velocity \\( v_0 \\) at an angle \\( \\theta \\) . The only force acting on it is gravity (ignoring air resistance). The motion is decomposed into horizontal and vertical components. Equations of Motion Using kinematic equations: Horizontal Motion (constant velocity, since no horizontal acceleration): \\[ x = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) t \\] Vertical Motion (accelerated motion under gravity): $$ y = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 $$ where: - \\( g \\) is the gravitational acceleration ( \\( 9.81 \\, m/s^2 \\) ). - \\( t \\) is the time elapsed. Time of Flight The time \\( T \\) when the projectile lands back on the ground ( \\( y = 0 \\) ) is found by solving: \\[ 0 = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) T - \\frac{1}{2} g T^2 \\] Factoring out \\( T \\) : \\[ T = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} \\] Range of the Projectile The range \\( R \\) is the total horizontal distance traveled before hitting the ground: \\[ R = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) T \\] Substituting \\( T \\) : \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} \\] Observations: - The range is maximized when \\( \\sin(2\\theta) \\) is maximum, which occurs at \\( 2\\theta = 90^\\circ \\) (i.e., \\( \\theta = 45^\\circ \\) ). - The range is symmetric around \\( 45^\\circ \\) , meaning that an angle of \\( 30^\\circ \\) and \\( 60^\\circ \\) will give the same range. Step 2: Analysis of the Range The range depends on: Initial Velocity \\(v_0\\) : Higher \\( v_0 \\) increases the range quadratically. Angle of Projection \\(\\theta\\) : The function \\( \\sin(2\\theta) \\) determines the shape of the range curve. Gravitational Acceleration \\(g\\) : Stronger gravity reduces the range.

Plots the range as a function of the angle \\( \\theta \\) . Explores different values of \\( v_0 \\) . Here is the plot showing the range of a projectile as a function of the launch angle for different initial velocities. Key Observations: The range follows a symmetric pattern with a peak at 45\u00b0 , confirming our theoretical derivation. The higher the initial velocity \\( v_0 \\) , the greater the range , as expected since range depends on \\( v_0^2 \\) . The function \\( R(\\theta) = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} \\) ensures that angles \\( \\theta \\) and \\( 90\u00b0 - \\theta \\) result in the same range , e.g., 30\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 produce identical distances .

Step 1: Theoretical Foundation 1.1 Governing Differential Equation The motion of a forced damped pendulum is governed by the following equation: \\[ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + \\gamma \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\frac{g}{L} \\sin\\theta = F_0 \\cos(\\omega t) \\] where: - \\( \\theta \\) is the angular displacement. - \\( \\gamma \\) is the damping coefficient (controls energy loss due to friction). - \\( g \\) is gravitational acceleration. - \\( L \\) is the length of the pendulum. - \\( F_0 \\) is the amplitude of the external driving force . - \\( \\omega \\) is the driving frequency . 1.2 Approximate Solution for Small Angles For small oscillations, we use the small-angle approximation : \\[ \\sin\\theta \\approx \\theta \\] This simplifies the equation to: \\[ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + \\gamma \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\frac{g}{L} \\theta = F_0 \\cos(\\omega t) \\] This is a driven damped harmonic oscillator equation , which has well-known solutions in terms of resonance and transient motion . 1.3 Resonance Conditions Resonance occurs when the external driving frequency matches the system's natural frequency : \\[ \\omega \\approx \\omega_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{L}} \\] If \\( \\gamma \\) (damping) is small, resonance leads to large oscillations . If \\( \\gamma \\) is large, oscillations remain damped. Step 2: Computational Simulation Since the equation is nonlinear , we'll use numerical methods to solve it. We'll integrate the equation using the Runge-Kutta method (RK4) to analyze different behaviors. 2.1 Implementation Plan Define the differential equation as a system of first-order ODEs.

Motivation The relationship between the square of the orbital period ( \\( T^2 \\) ) and the cube of the orbital radius ( \\( r^3 \\) ) is elegantly captured in Kepler\u2019s Third Law . This law provides a fundamental connection between orbital motion and gravitational forces, making it a critical concept in celestial mechanics . Understanding this relationship allows us to: - Calculate planetary masses and distances using observational data. - Predict satellite orbits, aiding space exploration. - Explain the motions of celestial bodies in our solar system and beyond. In this document, I will try to implement: 1. Derive Kepler\u2019s Third Law from Newton\u2019s laws. 2. Discuss its implications in astronomy. 3. Simulate orbital motion to verify the law computationally. 4. Analyze real-world cases like the Moon\u2019s orbit and planetary orbits in the Solar System. 2. Derivation of Kepler\u2019s Third Law For a planet orbiting a much more massive central body (e.g., a planet around the Sun or a moon around a planet), Newton\u2019s version of Kepler\u2019s Third Law can be derived from the equation of motion. Newton\u2019s Second Law & Centripetal Force For a body in a circular orbit, the gravitational force acts as the centripetal force : $$ F = \\frac{GMm}{r^2} = m\\frac{v^2}{r} $$ where: - \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant ( \\(6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{m}^3\\text{kg}^{-1}\\text{s}^{-2}\\) ) - \\( M \\) is the mass of the central body - \\( m \\) is the mass of the orbiting object - \\( r \\) is the orbital radius - \\( v \\) is the orbital velocity Since orbital velocity is related to period \\( T \\) by: $$ v = \\frac{2\\pi r}{T} $$ Substituting this into the force equation: $$ \\frac{GMm}{r^2} = m \\frac{\\left(\\frac{2\\pi r}{T}\\right)^2}{r} $$ Cancel \\( m \\) and rearrange: $$ \\frac{GM}{r^2} = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r}{T^2} $$ Multiplying by \\( r^2 \\) : $$ GM = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^3}{T^2} $$ Rearrange to find: $$ T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{GM} r^3 $$ This shows that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the orbital radius , i.e., $$ T^2 \\propto r^3 $$ 3. Implications for Astronomy Calculating Masses and Distances By measuring the orbital period and radius of a planet or moon, we can determine the mass of the central body . The formula is used extensively in calculating the mass of stars, planets, and even galaxies. Moon\u2019s orbit around Earth \u2014 a perfect real-world application of Kepler\u2019s Third Law and Newtonian gravity. Known Parameters : Mass of Earth : $$ 5.972 \\times 10^{24} \\, \\text{kg} $$ Average distance from Earth to Moon (r) : $$ 3.844 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m} $$ Orbital period of the Moon (T) : $$ 27.3 \\, \\text{days} = 2.36 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{seconds} $$ Using Kepler\u2019s Third Law We can verify this with the formula: $$ T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^3}{GM} $$ Let\u2019s compute the period from scratch and compare it to the known 27.3 days. Result: Moon\u2019s Orbital Period (Calculated) Calculated \\( T \\) : 2,371,877 seconds \u2248 27.45 days Real value: 27.3 days Our calculated value is extremely close to the observed orbital period \u2014 just a slight deviation due to averaging and simplifications (e.g., perfectly circular orbit assumption). This shows how Newton\u2019s version of Kepler\u2019s Third Law accurately predicts real-world motion . By just knowing distance and Earth\u2019s mass , we can compute how long it takes the Moon to orbit ! Exoplanet Discovery Kepler\u2019s Third Law is used to determine the mass of exoplanets based on their orbits around distant stars. 4. Computational Simulation of Circular Orbits We will now implement a Python simulation to verify the \\( T^2 \\propto r^3 \\) relationship numerically. The simulation will: 1. Define gravitational force and motion equations. 2. Simulate circular orbits using Newton\u2019s Laws. 3. Plot the relationship between \\( T^2 \\) and \\( r^3 \\) . Let's implement this: Orbital Simulation and Kepler\u2019s Law Verification 4.1 Scatter Plot of \\((T^2)\\) vs. \\((r^3)\\) with Best-Fit Line - The linear trendline confirms that \\((T^2)\\) is directly proportional to \\((r^3)\\) . - This supports Kepler\u2019s Third Law: \\((T^2 \\propto r^3)\\) . 4.2 Log-Log Plot of \\(T^2\\) vs. \\(r^3\\) - This logarithmic transformation helps visualize power-law relationships. - The straight-line pattern confirms the proportionality. 4.3 Circular Orbits of Multiple Planets at Different Radii - Each orbit represents a planet at increasing distances from the Sun. - According to Kepler\u2019s Law, planets farther away have longer orbital periods . 5. Discussion on Extensions and Real-World Cases Elliptical Orbits For elliptical orbits , Kepler\u2019s Third Law still holds when using the semi-major axis \\( a \\) instead of the orbital radius \\( r \\) . The equation remains: $$ T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{GM} a^3 $$ where \\( a \\) is the average distance of the object from the central body. Applications in Space Missions Used in designing satellite orbits (e.g., GPS satellites, geostationary orbits). Helps determine orbital transfer times , such as Hohmann transfer orbits used in interplanetary travel. Generalization to Binary Systems In binary star systems, Kepler\u2019s Law is adapted to consider both masses : $$ T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G(M_1 + M_2)} a^3 $$ where \\( M_1 \\) and \\( M_2 \\) are the masses of the two orbiting bodies. 6. Conclusion and Further Study Kepler\u2019s Third Law derived, implemented a computational verification, and explored real-world implications. This knowledge is foundational for space exploration, astrophysics, and planetary science! ### Simulation of Hohmann Transfer Orbit What's Happening in the Plot: Blue dashed circle : Earth's orbit (1 AU from the Sun).

Theoretical Principles The motion of the payload is governed by: Newton\u2019s Law of Universal Gravitation The initial velocity vector of the payload at release These determine whether the object enters orbit, escapes, or returns to Earth. Newton\u2019s Law of Gravitation The gravitational force between two masses is given by: \\[ \\vec{F} = - \\frac{GMm}{r^2} \\, \\hat{r} \\] Where: \\( G \\) : Gravitational constant \\( = 6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{N\u00b7m}^2/\\text{kg}^2 \\) \\( M \\) : Mass of the Earth \\( = 5.972 \\times 10^{24} \\, \\text{kg} \\) \\( m \\) : Mass of the payload \\( r \\) : Distance from Earth's center to the payload \\( \\hat{r} \\) : Unit vector pointing radially outward from Earth to the payload We use Newton's Second Law to derive the equation of motion: \\[ \\vec{a} = \\frac{\\vec{F}}{m} = - \\frac{GM}{r^2} \\hat{r} \\] This gives us a second-order differential equation for motion in 2D space: $$ \\frac{d^2\\vec{r}}{dt^2} = - \\frac{GM}{|\\vec{r}|^3} \\vec{r} $$ Kepler\u2019s Laws Kepler\u2019s Laws describe the motion of planets around the Sun and can be applied to any two-body orbital system: Law of Orbits Planets move in elliptical orbits with the Sun at one focus.
