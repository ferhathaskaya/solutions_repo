The horizontal and vertical components of motion are treated separately: Equations of Motion Horizontal Motion: \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc63 0 cos \u2061 ( \ud835\udf03 ) \ud835\udc61 x=v 0 \u200b cos(\u03b8)t The velocity remains constant in the absence of air resistance.

Time of Flight: The projectile reaches the ground when \ud835\udc66 = 0 y=0, solving for \ud835\udc61 t: \ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc53 = 2 \ud835\udc63 0 sin \u2061 ( \ud835\udf03 ) \ud835\udc54 t f \u200b = g 2v 0 \u200b sin(\u03b8) \u200b Range Equation: Using the time of flight in the horizontal equation: \ud835\udc45 = \ud835\udc63 0 cos \u2061 ( \ud835\udf03 ) \u22c5 2 \ud835\udc63 0 sin \u2061 ( \ud835\udf03 ) \ud835\udc54 R=v 0 \u200b cos(\u03b8)\u22c5 g 2v 0 \u200b sin(\u03b8) \u200b \ud835\udc45 \ud835\udc63 0 2 sin \u2061 ( 2 \ud835\udf03 ) \ud835\udc54 R= g v 0 2 \u200b sin(2\u03b8) \u200b This equation shows that range is maximized at \ud835\udf03 = 45 \u2218 \u03b8=45 \u2218 .

Step 3: Practical Applications Sports: Soccer, basketball, golf, etc. Engineering: Missile trajectories, cannonball physics. Astrophysics: Spacecraft landings on different planets (varying \ud835\udc54 g). Military Science: Optimal angles for artillery fire.
