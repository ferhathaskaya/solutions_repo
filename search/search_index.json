Step 1: Theoretical Foundation Derivation of Governing Equations A projectile is subject to uniform acceleration due to gravity and follows a parabolic trajectory. We assume: The projectile is launched with an initial velocity \\( v_0 \\) at an angle \\( \\theta \\) . The only force acting on it is gravity (ignoring air resistance). The motion is decomposed into horizontal and vertical components. Equations of Motion Using kinematic equations: Horizontal Motion (constant velocity, since no horizontal acceleration): \\[ x = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) t \\] Vertical Motion (accelerated motion under gravity): $$ y = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 $$ where: - \\( g \\) is the gravitational acceleration ( \\( 9.81 \\, m/s^2 \\) ). - \\( t \\) is the time elapsed. Time of Flight The time \\( T \\) when the projectile lands back on the ground ( \\( y = 0 \\) ) is found by solving: \\[ 0 = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) T - \\frac{1}{2} g T^2 \\] Factoring out \\( T \\) : \\[ T = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} \\] Range of the Projectile The range \\( R \\) is the total horizontal distance traveled before hitting the ground: \\[ R = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) T \\] Substituting \\( T \\) : \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} \\] Observations: - The range is maximized when \\( \\sin(2\\theta) \\) is maximum, which occurs at \\( 2\\theta = 90^\\circ \\) (i.e., \\( \\theta = 45^\\circ \\) ). - The range is symmetric around \\( 45^\\circ \\) , meaning that an angle of \\( 30^\\circ \\) and \\( 60^\\circ \\) will give the same range. Step 2: Analysis of the Range The range depends on: Initial Velocity \\(v_0\\) : Higher \\( v_0 \\) increases the range quadratically. Angle of Projection \\(\\theta\\) : The function \\( \\sin(2\\theta) \\) determines the shape of the range curve. Gravitational Acceleration \\(g\\) : Stronger gravity reduces the range. We will visualize how the range varies with \\( \\theta \\) for different \\( v_0 \\) values. Step 3: Computational Implementation Simulates projectile motion. Plots the range as a function of the angle \\( \\theta \\) . Explores different values of \\( v_0 \\) . Here is the plot showing the range of a projectile as a function of the launch angle for different initial velocities. Key Observations: The range follows a symmetric pattern with a peak at 45\u00b0 , confirming our theoretical derivation. The higher the initial velocity \\( v_0 \\) , the greater the range , as expected since range depends on \\( v_0^2 \\) . The function \\( R(\\theta) = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} \\) ensures that angles \\( \\theta \\) and \\( 90\u00b0 - \\theta \\) result in the same range , e.g., 30\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 produce identical distances . Step 4: Discussion on Model Limitations & Real-World Applications While the model is useful for idealized projectile motion , real-world scenarios involve: Air Resistance \u2013 Reduces range significantly, especially for high velocities. Wind Effects \u2013 Can increase or decrease range depending on direction. Uneven Terrain \u2013 Landing heights vary, affecting the actual range. Spin Effects \u2013 In sports, spin affects trajectory via the Magnus force (e.g., football or baseball).

Step 1: Theoretical Foundation 1.1 Governing Differential Equation The motion of a forced damped pendulum is governed by the following equation: \\[ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + \\gamma \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\frac{g}{L} \\sin\\theta = F_0 \\cos(\\omega t) \\] where: - \\( \\theta \\) is the angular displacement. - \\( \\gamma \\) is the damping coefficient (controls energy loss due to friction). - \\( g \\) is gravitational acceleration. - \\( L \\) is the length of the pendulum. - \\( F_0 \\) is the amplitude of the external driving force . - \\( \\omega \\) is the driving frequency . 1.2 Approximate Solution for Small Angles For small oscillations, we use the small-angle approximation : \\[ \\sin\\theta \\approx \\theta \\] This simplifies the equation to: \\[ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + \\gamma \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\frac{g}{L} \\theta = F_0 \\cos(\\omega t) \\] This is a driven damped harmonic oscillator equation , which has well-known solutions in terms of resonance and transient motion . 1.3 Resonance Conditions Resonance occurs when the external driving frequency matches the system's natural frequency : \\[ \\omega \\approx \\omega_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{L}} \\] If \\( \\gamma \\) (damping) is small, resonance leads to large oscillations . If \\( \\gamma \\) is large, oscillations remain damped. Step 2: Computational Simulation Since the equation is nonlinear , we'll use numerical methods to solve it. We'll integrate the equation using the Runge-Kutta method (RK4) to analyze different behaviors. 2.1 Implementation Plan Define the differential equation as a system of first-order ODEs. Implement numerical integration using the Runge-Kutta method . Explore different values of: Damping coefficient \\( \\gamma \\) . Driving force amplitude \\( F_0 \\) . Driving frequency \\( \\omega \\) . Visualize: Time evolution of \\( \\theta \\) (angular displacement) . Phase space plot ( \\(\\theta\\) vs. \\( \\dot{\\theta} \\) ) .

Simulation Results & Observations Time Evolution of Angular Displacement : The first plot shows how the pendulum\u2019s angle \\( \\theta(t) \\) changes over time. The oscillations exhibit damping but are also influenced by the external periodic force , leading to complex periodic motion. Phase Space Plot ( \\( \\theta \\) vs. \\( \\dot{\\theta} \\) ) : The second plot shows the pendulum's velocity vs. angle , forming a closed trajectory. This is characteristic of regular oscillations , but under different conditions, this could transition into chaotic motion . Step 3: Exploring Resonance and Chaos Resonance: If we set \\( \\omega = \\omega_0 = \\sqrt{g/L} \\) , we should see amplified oscillations . Chaos: Increasing driving amplitude \\( F_0 \\) significantly can lead to chaotic motion , where the phase space plot becomes highly irregular. Investigating Resonance Conditions Observations Under Resonance Conditions (The oscillations in the first plot show a significant increase in amplitude compared to the previous case.) (The second plot shows a much wider trajectory, indicating larger velocity variations.) Time Evolution of Angular Displacement : - This confirms that at resonance ( \\(\\omega = \\omega_0\\) ) , the external force adds energy efficiently, amplifying the motion. Phase Space Plot : - The pendulum's motion is more energetic and sustained , as expected in a resonance condition. Key Takeaways on Resonance: Resonance leads to maximum energy absorption , resulting in large oscillations. If damping is low , the system can experience runaway oscillations (dangerous in engineering). In real-world applications , engineers must avoid resonance in buildings, bridges, and aircraft structures to prevent failure. Investigating Chaos (The first plot shows irregular, unpredictable oscillations .) (The second plot shows a highly irregular trajectory , with no clear repeating patterns.) (The third plot is a Poincar\u00e9 section , which samples points at regular time intervals.) Observations Under Chaotic Conditions Time Evolution of Angular Displacement : - Unlike the smooth periodic motion seen before, the pendulum exhibits erratic behavior, a signature of chaotic motion . Phase Space Plot ( \\(\\theta\\) vs. \\(\\dot{\\theta}\\) ) : - This indicates sensitive dependence on initial conditions , a key characteristic of chaos . Poincar\u00e9 Section : - Instead of a single periodic point (as in regular motion), we see a scattered set of points . - This suggests a strange attractor , a hallmark of chaotic dynamics. Key Takeaways on Chaos: Chaos emerges when the external forcing overcomes damping and natural oscillations . Small changes in initial conditions can lead to drastically different outcomes (butterfly effect). Many real-world systems exhibit chaos, such as weather patterns, stock markets, and biological rhythms .","title":"Problem 2"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_2/#problem-2","text":"Investigating the Dynamics of a Forced Damped Pendulum The forced damped pendulum is a nonlinear dynamical system that exhibits simple harmonic motion, resonance, and even chaotic behavior under different conditions.","title":"Problem 2"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_2/#step-1-theoretical-foundation","text":"","title":"Step 1: Theoretical Foundation"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_2/#11-governing-differential-equation","text":"The motion of a forced damped pendulum is governed by the following equation: \\[ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + \\gamma \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\frac{g}{L} \\sin\\theta = F_0 \\cos(\\omega t) \\] where: - \\( \\theta \\) is the angular displacement. - \\( \\gamma \\) is the damping coefficient (controls energy loss due to friction). - \\( g \\) is gravitational acceleration. - \\( L \\) is the length of the pendulum. - \\( F_0 \\) is the amplitude of the external driving force . - \\( \\omega \\) is the driving frequency .","title":"1.1 Governing Differential Equation"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_2/#12-approximate-solution-for-small-angles","text":"For small oscillations, we use the small-angle approximation : \\[ \\sin\\theta \\approx \\theta \\] This simplifies the equation to: \\[ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + \\gamma \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\frac{g}{L} \\theta = F_0 \\cos(\\omega t) \\] This is a driven damped harmonic oscillator equation , which has well-known solutions in terms of resonance and transient motion .","title":"1.2 Approximate Solution for Small Angles"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_2/#13-resonance-conditions","text":"Resonance occurs when the external driving frequency matches the system's natural frequency : \\[ \\omega \\approx \\omega_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{L}} \\] If \\( \\gamma \\) (damping) is small, resonance leads to large oscillations .
